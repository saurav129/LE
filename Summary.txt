Listen up, my friend! I've got a script that's gonna blow your mind. This bad boy uses a linear regression model to predict salaries. We're talking big bucks here!

We've got data on the salaries of a thousand employees. Yeah, you heard me right. A thousand! We're diving deep into the world of numbers to analyze this dataset and unleash the power of linear regression.

Now, linear regression ain't some fancy jargon. It's a mathematical model that helps us find patterns and relationships between variables. In this case, we're looking at how different factors impact an employee's salary.

With this script, we'll crunch the numbers, analyze the data, and build a powerful regression model. We'll train it on the salary data of those thousand employees, teaching it to predict salaries like a true champ.

Once this model is trained, it's gonna become a salary-predicting machine. You feed it some input values like years of experience, education level, or any other relevant factors, and bam! It spits out a predicted salary like a knockout punch!

Think about the possibilities, my friend. You can use this script to make informed decisions, negotiate better salaries, or just satisfy your curiosity about what the future holds.
